# CIS362Recycling

Our team designed and deployed a survery, that underwent multiple revisions based off influences from focus groups to the UMass Dartmouth campus to uncover underlying recycling habits of faculty, staff and students at UMass Dartmouth. 
We gathered 225 responses and processed, modeled and visualized the data to extract useful information that was adopted by the office of Sustainability at UMass Dartmouth to hopefully increase recycling habits on campus.
