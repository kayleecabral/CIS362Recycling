# CIS362Recycling

Our team designed and deployed a survery to the UMass Dartmouth campus to uncover underlying recycling habits of faculty, staff and students at UMass Dartmouth. 
We gathered 225 responses and processed, modeled and visualized the data to extract useful information that was adopted by the office of Sustainability at UMass Dartmouth
to hopefully increase recycling habits on campus.
